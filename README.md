Exact and Heuristic Methods for the 0-1 Cubic Multiple and Multidimensional Knapsack Problems

In this project we intend to develop new heuristic and exact solution methods for the 0-1 cubic multiple and multidimensional knapsack problems.  The goal is to not only adapt techniques that have been developed for the quadratic versions of these problems, but to also design new methods as well.  Possibilities include advanced greedy algorithms, Tabu Search, genetic algorithms, and local search.  The project will entail both theoretical and coding components.
